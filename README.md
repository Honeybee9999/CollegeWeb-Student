For Developers
--------------------------------------------

>> This build is in no way complete. The functionalities are implemented but tidying up still remains to be done. 
Implementation of design on PHP is left to the lead developer to complete. Also, sequencing of pages need to be 
done so that when clicked, it redirects to the logical next page. 

>> If importing the SQL produces an error on PhpMyAdmin, uncheck 'partial import', 'enable foreign key check' and 'Do not   use AUTO_INCREMENT for zero values'. The proper way to do it is to create a new database called 'social network' and then import the tables from the file included. 


>> Also, errors might be produced because of the user data dump. In that case, open the sql file in Sublime Text/Atom/Notepad++ and delete the user data that I compiled at the time of testing.
